There are three types of Goodness in Weather Forecasts

1. **Consistency**

2. **Quality**

3. **Value**

##

Type 1 Goodness
: Consistency

- A forecaster's internal assessment is the **Judgement**
- A forecaster's external assessment is the **Forecast**
- Forecasts should correspond with the best Judgement

##

Type 2 Goodness
: Quality

- Correspondence between Forecasts and Observations
- Observations are not controllable

##

Type 3 Goodness
: Value

- Benefits realized/expenses incurred by using the forecast
- ex-ante forecast value

# Relating the three types of Goodness

For both Type 2 and Type 3 Goodness to be maximized, the best a forecaster can do is to provide forecasts consistent with the Judgement

- Consistency feeds directly into Quality and Value

## Consistency and Quality

- The Brier score
$$ BS = (f - x)^2 $$
*The MSE of probabilistic forecasts*

- Expected Brier score
$$ EBS = p(1 - p) + (f - p)^2 $$

- Differentiated with respect to $f$
$$= 2f - 2p$$

## Consistency and value

$EE(protect) = rC + (1 - r)C = C$  
$EE(\text{do not protect}) = rL + (1 - r)0 = rL$

**Cost-Loss ratio**  
$\text{C/L} \ll 1$, Low cost, easy to take measure  
C/L ~ 1, Cost close to Loss, measure may not be worth it

## Quality and Value

- Value is multivalued for a given skill
